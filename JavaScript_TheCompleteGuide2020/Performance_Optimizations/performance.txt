What is Performance? 

Can be split for two things : 
1. Startup time -
How long does it take to see something on the screen? 
How quickly is a user able to interact with the page?
2. Runtime performance - 
How smooth does the application run(are there freezes or lag)? 
How smooth do animations play? Are there any memory leaks in the page getting slower over time? 


What influences Performace? 
1. JS Execution: 
- How fast does the script load? (startup Time)
- How much work does the script do? 
- How much memory is occupied?


Different "Layers" of Performance Optimization 
1. Start-up time - Script Size: Delays initial parsing/Execution
Number of HTTP Roundtrips 
2. Runtime - Optimize code Execution, Dom Access: Avoid unnecessary code execution 
Avoid Memory Leaks: can crush you app 
find code Alternative with better Performance: Especially important for high-frequency code parts 
- Micro-optimization in your code: Optimize for a very specific use-case 

Measuring & Auditing 
Check Roundtrips + script size and set script/bundle size budgets 
Measure performance with dev tools 
explore best practice, patterns and benchmarks
