//Solve these problems:

//#1 Create a one line function that adds adds two parameters

//Closure: What does the last line return?
const addTo = x => y => x + y
var addToTen = addTo(10)
console.log(addToTen(3))
    //13

//Currying: What does the last line return?
const sum = (a, b) => a + b
const curriedSum = (a) => (b) => a + b
curriedSum(30)(1)
    //31


//Currying: What does the last line return?
const sum = (a, b) => a + b
const curriedSum = (a) => (b) => a + b
const add5 = curriedSum(5)
console.log(add5(12))
    //17


//Composing: What does the last line return?
const compose = (f, g) => (a) => f(g(a));
const add1 = (num) => num + 1;
const add5 = (num) => num + 5;
compose(add1, add5)(10)
    // 16

//What are the two elements of a pure function ? 
// 1. Deterministic - Same input, Same output( Every single time. this make them predictable and easily testable)
// 2. No Side-Effect ( no mutating input, logging, HTTP calls, writing to disc)
