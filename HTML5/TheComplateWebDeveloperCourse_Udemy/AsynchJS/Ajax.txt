When the browser was receiving any new information, they were not visible without refreshing the browser. 
To solve refreshing problem - Ajax technology was created which - it allows you to read from the webserver after the page was loaded 
and update the webpage without reloading the page 

invented in 2006 by Google 

Creating the Ajax call:(the old way): XHR 
let request = new XMLHttpRequest()
request.open("GET", "/my/url", true);

request.onload = function(){
    if(request.status >= 200 && request.status < 400){
        let data = JSON.parse(request.responseText);
    }else{
        //We reached our target server, but it returned an error
    }
}

request.onerror = function(){
    //There was a connection error of some sort
}
 request.send();


New way presented by jQuery:
$.getJSON("/my/url", function(data){

})

The new way in native js: Fetch
 fetch("/my/url").then(response => {
     console.log(response)
 })
