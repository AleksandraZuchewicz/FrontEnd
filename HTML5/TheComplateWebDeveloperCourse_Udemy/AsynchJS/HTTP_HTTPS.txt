in 1998 Tim Bernes-Lee invented the WorldWideWeb (WWW)
To sending information or any text you have to have a protocol. 
That's why he invented the HTTP - Hypertext transfer Protocole. 

With the Use of HTML and HTTP, we have the world wide web 

HTTP Methods: (communication with the server)
- Get - get a HTML file 
- Post - post something (eg. some data added to server )
- Put - update data I've send 
- Delete - delete a piece of data on the backend 

Server Response: 
- (HTTP Status Messages) 1xx, 2xx,3xx,4xx,5xx
- data (eg. new HTML file)

HTTPS - HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure - make password hashing
