Data when we POST something: 
when exchanging data between the server and browser the data can only by a text, so we cant just send JS object. 
Text can be understood by both ends. 

JSON - JavaScript Object Notation 
its a syntax for storing and exchanging data, 
JSON is a text, written with JS object Notation. 
Can be read by any language 

Two common method used with Json
JSON.Parse()
let obj = JSON.Parse("{"name":"John","Age":"30"}")
- its taking a JSON file and pasing it to the JS object 

The opposite way: 
JSON.stringify();

let myJSON = JSON.stringify(obj);
- it will chenge js obj into a JSON
