//Types of Images:
//1. Vector Image: type of image often associated with Adobe Illustrator. Illustration is rendered on a fly when the image is displayed
// Benefits: you can scale the image, without any size that you want without losing resolution.
// 2. Raster Image are like JPEGs or PNGs or Gifs. Every pixel has its own designated colour. when increasing the size, image is losing fidelity,
//as the dimensions are stretched

//What is canvas:
//HTML Element and JavaScript API
